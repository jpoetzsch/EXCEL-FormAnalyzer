# EXCEL-FormAnalyzer
Visual Studio files for formatter of complex EXCEL forms
If you often face the problem of having to analyze someone else's (or your own) complex EXCEL formulas, copy them into the input window of the analysis tool and display them in a structured manner in the output window.
Hierarchy levels are shown in indented form and as a level list. The tool does not analyze the formulas itself, the user has to understand them himself, but the formatting should help.
